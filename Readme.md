This is a simple calculator project that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. The calculator has a user interface (UI) with buttons for numbers (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), an equal sign (=) for calculation, and a clear button (C) to reset the calculator.

## Features:

- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

- Display the result of the calculation in the output field.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the calculator UI.
- CSS: Styling language for designing the calculator's appearance.
- JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and functionality to the calculator.
